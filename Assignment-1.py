
# **Q1.** Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# You can return the answer in any order.

# **Example:**
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output0 [0,1]

# **Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1][

## Answer:

def twoSum(nums, target):
    complement_map = {}  # Dictionary to store complements
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in complement_map:
            return [complement_map[complement], i]
        complement_map[num] = i

    return []
    
    
nums = [2,7,11,15]
target = 9

result = twoSum(nums, target)
print(result)

# result = [0, 1]

# ðŸ’¡ **Q2.** Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

# Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

#  Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
#  Return k.

# **Example :**
# Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
# Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_*,_*]

# **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)[

def removeElement(nums, val):
    k = 0  # pointer for the next position of non-val elements

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != val:
            nums[k] = nums[i]
            k += 1

    return k

    nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]
val = 3
result = removeElement(nums, val)
print(result)  # Output: 2

#ðŸ’¡ **Q3.** Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

#You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5

# Output: 2

# </aside>

def searchInsert(nums, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return left

searchInsert(nums, target)

ðŸ’¡ **Q4.** You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

**Example 1:**
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]

**Explanation:** The array represents the integer 123.

Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
